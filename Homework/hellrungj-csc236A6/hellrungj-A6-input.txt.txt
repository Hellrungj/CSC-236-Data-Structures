Eat, sleep and breathe that you're full of the stuff
Go back and tie up tight
Wheat-meat-dairy-free, tee total,
Happy clappy high on life
You should try it,
You should know (you should know)
You should know
Go on while no one's looking

A-ha! Caught you now!
Caught you red handed in the biscuit tin!
Cost you to keep me quiet

Golden boy boots
Pocket pedestal
Making sharp smart moves
Plastic, tin can, paper, separated
Busy bee wave, wave 'Save The Planet' flag
But sneaky in suburbia

A-ha! Candid camera!
Hook, line and sinker
For the four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet!
Keep me quiet! (keep me quiet!)

Nicest sweetest
Utmost in everything
It's so charming, very charming
Well reckon play the fool no one's ill at ease
And put the deepest Swiss bank trust in you
No one saw it coming

Cost you to keep me quiet.

It's so hard when people knock you down and tell you that you're never gonna get a shot at glory
But that's when you rise to the challenge, 'cause it's your time, your moment, and nothing can stop us now!

PTX, get up! What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit.
Get up! Fresh out, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweatergang nope nope y’all can’t copy
Yup. Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
Ha! and we do it, our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record
And yep yep yep yep I’m on
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T cause ha,
Chasing dreams since we were 14
With the four track
Bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack,
Fat cat, crushing

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us,
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
We put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. yeah I'm so dang grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Texas raised you
Y’all can’t stop me, go hard
Like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat
Like I gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week
Raise those hands, this is a party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility keep marching

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us,
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Pa ra rap pa pa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa paaa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa pa
(Pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa
(and so we put our hands up)

(Oooh whoa!)
Pa ra rap pa pa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa paaa
(Pa pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa pa
(Pa pa pa)
Pa pa pa
Let's go!

[3x]
Nana nana nana nana
Oh
(and so we put our hands up)

Nana nana nana nana
Ooh Whoa whoa!!!!

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us (like the ceiling can’t hold us)
Like the ceiling can’t hold us

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
We put our hands up
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
I'm waking up to ash and dust,
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust,
I'm breathing in, the chemicals.
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus.
This is it, the apocalypse, woah.

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

I'm breaking in, shaping up, 
then checking out on the prison bus.
This is it, the apocalypse, woah.

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

All systems go, sun hasn't died.
Deep in my bones, straight from inside.

I'm waking up, I'm waking up, I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
(Enough) to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.
Hey!
